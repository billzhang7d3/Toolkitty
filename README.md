# Toolkitty
A Discord bot with a set of commands that I would find useful for myself, from image hosting to conversation summarization. This repo simply has the source code I have for the bot, excluding the Node modules.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

## USAGE
To duplicate this project into a different discord bot, follow the instructions [here](https://discordjs.guide/) to set up the basic functionality. Then the repo can be cloned.
